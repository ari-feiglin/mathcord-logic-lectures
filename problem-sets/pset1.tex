        \item Show that $\set{\neg,\to}$ is functional complete.
        \item Show that $\lor$ can be represented in terms of $\to$ alone.
        \item Show that any formula $\phi$ over the signature $\to$ has $w\phi=1$ for the
        valuation $w$ which evaluates every variable as $1$.
        \item Show that $\land$ cannot be represented in terms of $\to$ alone.
        \item Show that $\oto$ cannot be represented in terms of $\to$ alone.

    We define the boolean {\it nand} connective, $\uparrow$, as follows:
    $$ \pmatrix{1 & 1\cr 1 & 0} $$
    and {\it nor}, $\downarrow$:
    $$ \pmatrix{1 & 0\cr 0 & 0} $$
    \benum
        \item Verify that $\alpha\uparrow\beta\equiv\neg(\alpha\land\beta)$ and
        $\alpha\downarrow\beta\equiv\neg(\alpha\lor\beta)$.
        \item Show that both $\set\uparrow$ and $\set\downarrow$ are functional complete.
        \item Show that if $\circ$ is a boolean connective and $\set\circ$ is functional
        complete, $\circ\in\set{\uparrow,\downarrow}$.

    Let $\phi\to\psi$ be a tautology, then show that there exists a formula $\theta$ which uses
    only variables common to both $\phi$ and $\psi$ (i.e.
    $\var\theta\subseteq\var\phi\cap\var\psi$), such that both $\phi\to\theta$ and $\theta\to\psi$
    are tautologies.

    Let $\phi$ be a formula, we define its {\it dual}, $\phi^\delta$, recursively as follows:
    $$ \pi^\delta = \pi \hbox{ for prime $\pi$},\qquad (\neg\alpha)^\delta=\neg\alpha^\delta,
    \qquad (\alpha\land\beta)^\delta = (\alpha^\delta\lor\beta^\delta),\qquad
    (\alpha\lor\beta)^\delta = (\alpha^\delta\land\beta^\delta) $$
    Equivalently, it just substitutes all $\land$ in $\phi$ with $\lor$ and all $\lor$ with
    $\land$.

    Let $f\colon\set{0,1}^n\longto\set{0,1}$ be a boolean function, we define its {\it dual} to be
    $$ f^\delta\bar x = \neg f(\neg\bar x) $$

    \benum
        \item Show that if $\alpha$ represents $f$, then $\alpha^\delta$ represents $f^\delta$.
        \item Show that $f\mapsto f^\delta$ is a bijection on boolean functions.
        \item Using the fact that every boolean function can be represented by a DNF, show that
        every boolean function can be represented by a CNF.

    Let $\bar x=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ and $\bar y=(y_1,\dots,y_n)$ be boolean vectors.
    We write $\bar x\leq\bar y$ to mean $x_i\leq y_i$ for all $i=1,\dots,n$.
    A boolean function $f$ is said to be {\it increasing} if $\bar x\leq\bar y$ implies
    $f\bar x\leq f\bar y$.

    Show that every increasing boolean function can be represented in the logical signature
    $\set{{\land},{\lor}}$ and vice versa: every formula in this logical signature is increasing.
